# Hybrid-Chaining-Model
This Project is a graphical visualization of hashing technique. 
Unlike the normal hashing technique in arrays, this project uses the concept of Binary Search trees (BST) and Self Balancing Trees (AVL). The keys are stored in the AVL while the actual value is stored in BST against that key in AVL making Searching, Insertion and Deletion faster. 

Tools: 
C++ Language
BGI Graphics

Method:
1- Open project with visual studio
2- Add Bgi graphics library
3- Run The Project
